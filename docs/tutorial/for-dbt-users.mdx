  All dbt projects are also valid metriql projects. metriql creates [datasets](/introduction/creating-datasets) from all your dbt `models`, `seeds`, and `sources`. The only missing part is the metric (aka measure) definitions. metriql makes use of dbt's `meta` properties so you can model your data by adding extra properties to the [`meta`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/meta) field.

<TabItem value="rakam">

1. Create a project on Rakam using database credentials.

2. Click the `Integrate your GIT repository` button on Develop page. (Please note that if your repository is private, you need to add the generated SSH key into your repository for Rakam to be able to access your repository.)

Once you connect to your repository, we will automatically synchronize your `models`, `seeds`, and `sources`.

metriql automatically creates dimensions for each column definitions in your resource files and you can add your custom metric definitions under `meta` property as follows:

```yml
models:
 - name: customers
   columns:
     - name: country_code
       meta:
         metriql.dimension:
           type: string
     - name: city
       meta:
         metriql.dimension:
           type: string
     - name: total_customers
       description: total number of customers defined as count(*) in sql
       meta:
         metriql.measure:
    	    aggregation: sum
```

In addition to column mapping, you can also create custom measures and dimensions by defining them under `meta` or the model:

```yml
models:
  - name: customers
    meta:
      metriql:
         measures:
            total_rows:
               aggregation: count
         dimensions:
            full_location:
	            sql: CONCAT({TABLE}.country, {TABLE}.city)   
	            type: string
```

Congratulations, you created your first dataset in dbt! Now, we need to use metriql CLI to expose out dataset:

* Run [`metriql serve`](/metriql-cli/cli-overview#installation) command.

You can follow the links below as the next step:

* Learn more about the data modeling concept in [Creating Datasets](/introduction/creating-datasets).
* See [full reference](/reference/dataset) of dataset properties.
* Start [consuming your data](/query/introduction).
